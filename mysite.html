        <h2>Physiology</h2>

        <p>Eevee is a small, fox-like creature with brown fur. Its muzzle is very catlike, with a small, black and triangular nose. It has a fluffy, cream-colored ruff around its neck and a brown, bushy fox-like tail with a cream-colored tip. 
           Eevee has round, brown eyes, long rabbit-like ears, and pink paw pads on its feet. Its paws are small with three toes and no visible claws. 
           A shiny Eevee has silver fur instead of brown, and its ruff and tail-tip are white instead of cream.</p>

        <p>Eevee is said to have an irregularly-shaped genetic structure, enabling it to evolve into multiple different forms, which depends if it touches a stone or its relationship to their Trainer.</p>

        <h2>Evolutions</h2>

        <p>Eevee has eight evolutions that can be achieved through various stones or high friendship.</p>
